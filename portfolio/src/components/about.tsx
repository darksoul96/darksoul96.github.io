            <h1>About me!</h1>
            <br />
            <p>
            I am an advanced software engineering student with a strong foundation in programming that began during my high school years. <br />
            <br />
Transitioning to college, I pursued further education in Informatics Engineering (Computer Science), where I have continued to
expand my engineering expertise. <br /><br />
Currently in my final year of studies, I have honed my programming skills and gained practical
experience in various engineering projects. <br /><br />
I had the privilege of developing and mantaining a project called MyCareReports owned
by the Cancer Support Community. <br /><br />
Furthermore, I have actively maintained my personal repository, where I have undertaken
several projects showcasing my skills in software engineering, including web, mobile and desktop applications. <br /><br />
This diverse experience has strengthened my
problem-solving abilities and my commitment to delivering innovative solutions. <br/>
Oh, and by the way I'm also a big C++ enthusiast.
